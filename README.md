# NOTE
## This is a project is ancient and not maintained.
### This was a university project that was written for ancient versions of Cassandra and Hector.

I vaguely recall Cassandra being some clever non-relational database system and Hector being
a rather awful query language for it.  I wouldn't be surprised if both have moved on to become other
things by now.

You can blame [@acobley](https://github.com/acobley) for this.  He set the assignment at university all those years ago.
I'm pretty sure he was just a bit excited at the idea of Cassandra at the time ;)
